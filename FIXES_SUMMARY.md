# Twitch App Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. NewsAPI 426 Error
**Problem**: The app was using a demo API key that returned a 426 status error.

**Solution**:
- Updated the API key to use the provided key: `db94af2f4bac408ab8084f22a7a2c9c6`
- Improved error handling with better fallback logic
- Added detailed logging for debugging API issues
- Implemented multiple fallback levels:
  1. Primary: NewsAPI with correct key
  2. Secondary: Quotable.io API for inspirational quotes
  3. Tertiary: Static fallback content

### 2. /api/set-language 404 Error
**Problem**: The endpoint was returning 404 errors, likely due to missing CORS headers or invalid session handling.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive CORS headers to allow cross-origin requests
- Improved error handling and debugging with detailed logging
- Enhanced validation for sessionId and language parameters
- Better error messages to help identify the root cause
- Added OPTIONS method handling for preflight requests

## Files Modified

1. **twitch_data_processor.js**:
   - Added CORS middleware
   - Updated NewsAPI key and error handling
   - Enhanced `/api/set-language` endpoint with better debugging
   - Improved fallback logic for external data fetching

2. **test_fixes.js** (new):
   - Test script to verify the fixes work correctly
   - Tests server health, language setting, and error handling

3. **test_fixes.bat** (new):
   - Windows batch file to easily run the test script

## How to Test

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   node test_fixes.js
   ```
   Or on Windows:
   ```bash
   test_fixes.bat
   ```

3. Check the server logs for detailed information about API calls and error handling.

## Expected Results

- NewsAPI calls should now work with the correct API key
- If NewsAPI fails, the app should gracefully fall back to quotes or static content
- `/api/set-language` endpoint should work correctly with proper error messages
- CORS issues should be resolved for web-based requests

## Additional Notes

- The app now has better error resilience for external API calls
- All endpoints include comprehensive logging for easier debugging
- CORS is properly configured for web-based dashboard access
- Session management is more robust with better error handling
